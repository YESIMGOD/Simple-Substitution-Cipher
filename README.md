# Simple-Substitution-Cipher
A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. 
In Simple Substitution Cipher, the basic idea is,"take one letter from the input text and change it with another letter depending upon the key user has entered."
For example:
If key = 3 (Caesar Cipher: A Speacial case of simple substitution cipher) 
Plain Text:  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
Cipher Text: D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C

Text: india
Cipher: L Q G L D
